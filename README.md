# 21 Days of Data 📊

Welcome to my **21 Days of Data** journey! This repository contains guided data projects designed for beginners who want to build practical data analysis skills through hands-on learning.

## 🎯 About This Challenge

The 21 Days of Data challenge is a structured learning path where I work through data analysis projects, one day at a time. Each project is designed to reinforce fundamental data skills while building real-world experience.

### Why 21 Days?

- **Manageable commitment**: Three weeks is enough time to build a habit without feeling overwhelming
- **Progressive learning**: Each day builds upon previous concepts
- **Tangible results**: You'll have 21 completed projects to showcase your learning

## 👥 Who Is This For?

This repository is perfect for:
- **Beginners** starting their data journey
- **Career changers** moving into data-related fields
- **Students** looking to supplement their learning
- **Anyone** curious about data analysis and visualization

## 📚 What You'll Learn

Through these guided projects, you'll develop skills in:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- Statistical analysis basics
- Working with real-world datasets
- Python/R programming for data analysis
- Documenting your analysis process

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

```
21-Days-Of-Data/
├── Day-01/          # First day's project
├── Day-02/          # Second day's project
├── ...
├── Day-21/          # Final project
└── README.md        # This file
```

Each day's folder typically contains:
- Project description and goals
- Dataset(s) used
- Code/notebooks with analysis
- Visualizations and outputs
- Key learnings and takeaways

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Python 3.7+ or R installed on your computer
- A code editor (VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, or RStudio recommended)

3. **Start with Day 1** and work your way through!

## 📖 How to Use This Repository

1. **Follow along**: Start with Day 1 and complete one challenge per day
2. **Learn by doing**: Try to solve challenges yourself before looking at solutions
3. **Experiment**: Modify the code, try different approaches, break things and learn
4. **Document**: Keep notes on what you learn each day
5. **Share**: Share your progress on social media with #21DaysOfData

## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Consistency is key**: Try to complete one project each day
- **Don't skip days**: Each project builds on previous concepts
- **Ask questions**: Use Stack Overflow, Reddit, or data communities when stuck
- **Make it your own**: Customize projects with different datasets or questions
- **Celebrate progress**: Share your wins, no matter how small!
